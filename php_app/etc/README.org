* Introduction

This directory houses configuration files required for docker-compose.

* Notes

Some things which you should note for making the docker compose setup
work:

- The path location for both nginx and php-fpm docker images should be
  same. (an easy mistake to make)
- The nginx refers to the fpm service using the service name. This is
  how it's defined in the nginx configuration:

#+begin_example conf
fastcgi_pass web:9000;
#+end_example

As you can see we don't specificy ~localhost:9000~ and instead refer
by the service name here.
