* Introduction

This overlay implements blue green deployment using NGINX
controller. There are two applications here:

- blue application ([[https://hub.docker.com/layers/argoproj/rollouts-demo/blue/images/sha256-3225193a6415b14b3fcdd160c40248b2bfd62f8c77326480559b91a41ced6e20?context=explore][blue application]])
- green application ([[https://hub.docker.com/r/argoproj/rollouts-demo/tags?page=1&name=green][green applicaion]])

The objective is to switch the traffic from the blue environment to
the green environment once testing is complete on the green
environment.

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- NGINX controller
- cert-manager
- external-dns

You might want to change the hostname in the following ingresses:

- [[file:green_ingress.yaml][Green ingress]]
- [[file:ingress.yaml][Blue ingress]]

* Usage

Make sure it builds fine:

#+begin_src sh
$ just build-nginx-bg-app
#+end_src

Now go ahead and deploy it:

#+begin_src
❯ just apply-nginx-bg-app
kustomize build overlays/nginx_blue_green > nginx_bg.yaml
kubectl apply -f nginx_bg.yaml
namespace/app created
service/blue created
deployment.apps/blue created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/blue created
#+end_src

* Test the applications

There are two applications to test:

- Let's check the blue application

#+begin_example sh
❯ curl -s https://BLUE_REDACTED/color
"blue"
#+end_example

- And the green application:

#+begin_example sh
❯ curl -s https://GREEN_REDACTED/color
"green"
#+end_example

* Switch traffic from blue to green

To switch the blue app to use the green app, modify the blue [[file:service.yaml][service]]
and switch the selector

  #+begin_src diff
  selector:
-    app: blue
+    app: green
  #+end_src

And then re-apply you manifests again. You can again test the blue
application and you can see a different response:

#+begin_example sh
❯ curl -s https://BLUE_REDACTED/color
"green"
#+end_example

* Destruction

#+begin_example sh
$ just remove-nginx-bg-app
kubectl delete -f nginx_bg.yaml
namespace "app" deleted
service "blue" deleted
service "green" deleted
deployment.apps "blue" deleted
deployment.apps "green" deleted
ingress.networking.k8s.io "blue" deleted
ingress.networking.k8s.io "green" deleted
#+end_example
