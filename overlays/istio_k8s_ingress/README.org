* Introduction

This overlay is same as [[../istio][istio]] but uses kubernetes ingress
gateway which *istio* as the ingress class.

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- istio
- cert-manager

* Usage

Make sure it builds fine:

#+begin_src sh
$ just build-istio-k8s-ingress-app
#+end_src

Now go ahead and deploy it:

#+begin_src
$ just apply-istio-k8s-ingress-app
#+end_src

Now go to [[https://READACTED][https://READACTED]] to access your application.

* Destruction

#+begin_src sh
$ just remove-istio-k8s-ingress-app
kubectl delete -f istio.yaml
namespace "base-app" deleted
service "httpbin" deleted
deployment.apps "httpbin" deleted
