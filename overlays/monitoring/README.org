* Introduction

This overlay deploys an application to the k8s cluster along with pod
monitor to instruct prometheus to scrape it's metrics. This takes the
manifets and adapts it from [[https://github.com/brancz/prometheus-example-app][this upstream project]].

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- prometheus-operator

* Usage

Make sure it builds fine:

#+begin_src sh
$ just build-istio-app
#+end_src

Now go ahead and deploy it:

#+begin_src
$ just apply-istio-app
#+end_src

Now go to [[https://READACTED][https://READACTED]] to access your application.
