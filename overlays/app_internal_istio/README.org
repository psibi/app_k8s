* Introduction

This overlay is same as [[../basic_app_internal][basic_app_internal]] but additional has istio
gateway and virtual service. The gateway is annotated to use cloud
provider's internal load balancer.

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- istio: We assume that istio is configured with additional gateway
  backed by cloud provider's internal load balancer.

You might want to change the hostname or the selector in the gateway
and virtualservice:

- gateway.yaml
- virtualservice.yaml

* Usage

Make sure it builds fine:

#+begin_src sh
$ make build-app-internal-istio:
#+end_src

Now go ahead and deploy it:

#+begin_src
$ make apply-app-internal-istio
kustomize build overlays/app_internal_istio > istio.yaml
kubectl apply -f istio.yaml
namespace/base-app unchanged
service/httpbin unchanged
deployment.apps/httpbin unchanged
gateway.networking.istio.io/httpbin unchanged
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/httpbin configured
#+end_src

Now get the IP of the internal load balancer and exec into one of the
pod of the cluster (since it's internal LB):

#+begin_example
curl -s -I -H Host:httpin.example.com http://internal-ip:80/status/200
#+end_example

* Destruction

#+begin_src sh
$ make remove-app-internal-istio
kubectl delete -f istio.yaml
namespace "base-app" deleted
service "httpbin" deleted
deployment.apps "httpbin" deleted
gateway.networking.istio.io "httpbin" deleted
virtualservice.networking.istio.io "httpbin" deleted
#+end_src
