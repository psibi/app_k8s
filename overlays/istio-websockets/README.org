* Introduction

This overlay is same as [[../istio][istio]] but uses websocket application. But this
demonstrates a sidecar container pattern in istio mesh with nginx
acting as a reverse proxy.

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- istio
- cert-manager

You might want to change the hostname or the selector in the gateway
and virtualservice:

- istio.yaml

You might also want to change the host in the certificate:

- certificate.yaml

* Usage

#+begin_src sh
$ make apply-istio-websockets
kubectl apply -k overlays/basic_app
namespace/base-app created
service/httpbin created
deployment.apps/httpbin created
#+end_src

And let's check it's external IP:

#+begin_src sh
$ kubectl get services -n websocket
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
httpbin   LoadBalancer   10.0.26.9    REDACTED         8000:30342/TCP   61s
#+end_src

Now you can go and visit the address [[http://READACTED:8000][http://READACTED:8000]] to see the
application running.

* Destruction

#+begin_src sh
$ make remove-base-app
kubectl delete -k overlays/basic_app
namespace "base-app" deleted
service "httpbin" deleted
deployment.apps "httpbin" deleted
#+end_src
