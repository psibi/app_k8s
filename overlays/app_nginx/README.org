* Introduction

This overlay is same as [[../basic_app/][basic_app]] but uses Ingress manifest from
[[https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/][ingress-nginx]].

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- [[https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/][ingress-nginx]]

You can check it like this:

#+begin_src sh
$ kubectl get services -n kube-addons
NAME                                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                      AGE
ingress-nginx-controller             LoadBalancer   10.0.43.218   READACTED      80:30749/TCP,443:30328/TCP   18s
ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP      10.0.3.0      <none>         443/TCP                      19s
#+end_src

Note that in my case, I have deployed it in the namespace
/kube-addons/. It might be different in your case.

* Usage

Make sure it builds fine:

#+begin_src sh
$ make build-basic-nginx-app
kustomize build overlays/app_nginx -o app
kubectl apply -f app/v1_namespace_base-app.yaml
namespace/base-app created
kubectl apply -f app/apps_v1_deployment_httpbin.yaml
deployment.apps/httpbin created
kubectl apply -f app/v1_service_httpbin.yaml
service/httpbin created
kubectl apply -f app/networking.k8s.io_v1beta1_ingress_ingress-httpbin.yaml
ingress.networking.k8s.io/ingress-httpbin created
#+end_src

Now go to [[http://READACTED:8000][http://READACTED]] to access your application.

* Destruction

#+begin_src sh
make remove-basic-nginx-app
namespace "base-app" deleted
service "httpbin" deleted
deployment.apps "httpbin" deleted
ingress.networking.k8s.io "ingress-httpbin" deleted
#+end_src
