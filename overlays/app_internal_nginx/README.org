* Introduction

This overlay is same as [[../app_internal_istio][app_internal_istio]] but uses internal nginx.

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- internal nginx controller

You might want to change the hostname in the ingress manifest:

- ingress.yaml

* Usage

Make sure it builds fine:

#+begin_src sh
$ just build-app-internal-istio:
#+end_src

Now go ahead and deploy it:

#+begin_src
$ just apply-app-internal-nginx
#+end_src

* Destruction

#+begin_src sh
$ just remove-app-internal-nginx
#+end_src
