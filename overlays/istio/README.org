* Introduction

This overlay is same as [[../app_ssl_nginx/][app_ssl_nginx]] but uses istio ingress gateway.

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- istio
- cert-manager

You might want to change the hostname and/or the selector in the gateway
and virtualservice according to your setup:

- [[file:gateway.yaml][gateway.yaml]]
- [[file:certificate.yaml][certificate.yaml]]
- [[file:virtualservice.yaml][virtualservice.yaml]]

* Usage

Make sure it builds fine:

#+begin_src sh
$ just build-istio-app
#+end_src

Now go ahead and deploy it:

#+begin_src
$ just apply-istio-app
kustomize build overlays/istio > istio.yaml
kubectl apply -f istio.yaml
namespace/base-app created
service/httpbin created
deployment.apps/httpbin created
gateway.networking.istio.io/httpbin-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/httpbin created
kubectl apply -f overlays/istio/certificate.yaml
certificate.cert-manager.io/httpbin-ingress-cert created
#+end_src

Now go to [[https://READACTED][https://READACTED]] to access your application.

* Destruction

#+begin_src sh
$ just remove-istio-app
kubectl delete -f istio.yaml
namespace "base-app" deleted
service "httpbin" deleted
deployment.apps "httpbin" deleted
gateway.networking.istio.io "httpbin-gateway" deleted
virtualservice.networking.istio.io "httpbin" deleted
kubectl delete -f overlays/istio/certificate.yaml
certificate.cert-manager.io "httpbin-ingress-cert" deleted
kubectl delete secret/httpbin-ingress-cert -n istio-system
secret "httpbin-ingress-cert" deleted
#+end_src
