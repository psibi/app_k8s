* Introduction

This overlay is same as [[../app_self_ssl_nginx/][app_self_ssl_nginx]] but uses certificates from
cert-manager..

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- [[https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/][ingress-nginx]]

You can check it like this:

#+begin_src sh
$ kubectl get services -n kube-addons
NAME                                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                      AGE
ingress-nginx-controller             LoadBalancer   10.0.43.218   READACTED      80:30749/TCP,443:30328/TCP   18s
ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP      10.0.3.0      <none>         443/TCP                      19s
#+end_src

Note that in my case, I have deployed it in the namespace
/kube-addons/. It might be different in your case.

* Usage

Make sure it builds fine:

#+begin_src sh
$ make build-ssl-nginx-app
#+end_src

Now go ahead and deploy it:

#+begin_src
$ make apply-ssl-nginx
#+end_src

Now go to [[https://READACTED][https://READACTED]] to access your application.

* Destruction

#+begin_src sh
$ make remove-ssl-nginx
kubectl delete -f nginx_app.yaml
namespace "base-app" deleted
service "httpbin" deleted
deployment.apps "httpbin" deleted
Warning: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 Ingress is deprecated in v1.19+, unavailable in v1.22+; use networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress
ingress.networking.k8s.io "ingress-httpbin" deleted
#+end_src
