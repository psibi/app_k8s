injection enabled and uses strict mTLS for the workload.

* Pre-requisites

For this overlay to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- prometheus-operator
- istio (assumes [[https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/prometheus/#option-1-metrics-merging][metrics merging]] is happening)

#+begin_src sh
$ build-monitoring-istio-app
#+end_src

#+begin_src
$ just apply-monitoring-istio-app
#+end_src
