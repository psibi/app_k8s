* Introduction

Modified version of [[file:~/github/app_k8s/php_app/][php_app]], but uses sidecar pattern to serve both
static images as well as the PHP application. This is basically an
implementation [[https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/4822#issuecomment-564645515][of this comment]].

These are the files that comprises the application:

- [[file:hello.php][hello.php]]
- [[file:Dockerfile][Dockerfile]]
- [[file:linux.png][linux.png]]

* Pre-requisites

For this base to work, following components are assumed to be
installed in your k8s cluster:

- [[https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/][ingress-nginx]]
- cert-manager

Following are the things you need to edit before deploying this
application:

- [[file:ingress.yaml][ingress.yaml]]
  - The host name
  - cert manager cluster issuer annotation value

* Usage

Make sure it builds fine. Then you can apply it like this:

#+begin_src sh
$ just apply-php-mixed-app
kustomize build php_app_mixed > php_app_mixed.yaml
kubectl apply -f php_app_mixed.yaml
namespace/php-app unchanged
configmap/nginx-config configured
service/phpapp unchanged
deployment.apps/phpapp configured
ingress.networking.k8s.io/phpapp unchanged
#+end_src

And then you can check it like this:

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim
curl https://REDACTED | rg "<title>"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:         <title>PHP Hello World!</title>
: <title>phpinfo()</title><meta name="ROBOTS" content="NOINDEX,NOFOLLOW,NOARCHIVE" /></head>

* Destruction

#+begin_src sh
$ just remove-php-mixed-app
kubectl delete -f php_app.yaml
namespace "php-app" deleted
configmap "phpapp-cm" deleted
service "phpapp" deleted
deployment.apps "phpapp" deleted
ingress.networking.k8s.io "phpapp" deleted
#+end_src
